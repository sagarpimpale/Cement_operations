## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Training

The system uses pre-trained models but can be retrained with plant-specific data:

```python
# Example: Retraining raw materials model
optimizer = RawMaterialGrindingOptimizer(api_key)
plant_data = load_plant_data('your_data.csv')
optimizer.train_models(plant_data)
```

### Custom Thresholds

Modify optimization thresholds in each module:

```python
# Example: Custom energy efficiency targets
ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_TARGET = 85.0  # kWh/ton
CO2_EMISSIONS_TARGET = 850      # kg/ton
STRENGTH_MIN_REQUIREMENT = 52.5  # MPa
```

### Alert Configuration

Customize alert levels and notification preferences:

```python
ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
    'energy_high': 95.0,
    'strength_low': 50.0,
    'co2_high': 900,
    'power_factor_low': 0.85
}
```

## 📊 Data Requirements

### Input Data Format

The system expects data in the following format for training:

```csv

   Solution: Install missing dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   ```
   Error: Out of memory during model training
   Solution: Reduce training data size or increase system RAM
   ```

4. **Slow Performance**
   ```
   Issue: Dashboard loading slowly
   Solution: Clear browser cache, restart Streamlit application
   ```

### Performance Optimization

- **Data Caching**: Enable Streamlit caching for large datasets
- **Model Persistence**: Save trained models to disk
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple predictions simultaneously
- **Memory Management**: Clear unused variables and data

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- API communications are encrypted (HTTPS)

### Access Control
- Implement user authentication for production deployment
- Role-based access to different optimization modules
- Audit logging for all optimization actions

### Backup Strategy
- Regular backups of model files and configurations
- Export critical optimization parameters
- Document custom modifications and settings
